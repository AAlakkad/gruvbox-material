### Port to other apps

It should be very easy to port this color scheme to other apps. The original gruvbox is now available for so many apps, simply replacing the hex color code should work.

See [morhetz/gruvbox-contrib](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) for all available ports of the original gruvbox.

For the color reference of this color scheme, see [palette-dark.yml](https://github.com/gruvbox-material/gruvbox-material/blob/master/palette-dark.yml) and [palette-light.yml](https://github.com/gruvbox-material/gruvbox-material/blob/master/palette-light.yml).
